You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].

I'm a film producer, a martial arts practitioner inducted into the Masters Hall of Fame, I also write in my spare time, but don't be alarmed, it's going nowhere. My production company is Pathbender Media.


##Filmmaking
I am a [filmmaker](http://pathbender.squarespace.com/ethompson) with a [production comany](http://pathbender.squarespace.com). Here is a little recent [press](http://pathbender.squarespace.com/press) and some [projects](http://pathbender.squarespace.com/development) I have in [development](http://pathbender.squarespace.com/development).


##Social Media
I'm on [Ello](https://ello.co/EThompson), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ETThompson), [Linked in](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ethmpsn) and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/112339756947592421267/). I have a [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/etthompson/) account because, obviously, we are all supposed to. I am also on [Quora](http://www.quora.com/ET-Thompson). If that wasn't enough, here is an [About.me](http://about.me/etthompson). I have also been a [martial arts](http://www.fightproof.blogspot.com/) practitioner for a very long time, a Masters Hall of Fame inductee. I also write in my spare time, but don't be alarmed, it's going nowhere.



I was formally:

- The president of a genre film production company
- A consultant for Asian film companies
- A celebrity bodyguard
- A bouncer in several bars across the country
- Kickboxing trainer for a world champion
- The World’s Most Dangerous Receptionist

I am also a lifetime martial artist and a member of The Masters Hall of Fame. I am the creator of Fight Proof™ Applied Martial Arts. I do seminars, mostly for use of force professionals.

I was also told I look like Brad Pitt from behind by a very drunk lady with questionable teeth.
