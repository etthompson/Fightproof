<blockquote>
<p>Michael Cimino&rsquo;s filmmaking journey was hardly a bumpless ride. It seems that his name is unfortunately doomed to go down in history as of a director whose third film completely ruined his career&mdash;<em>Heaven&rsquo;s Gate</em> not only led a distinguished American studio into bankruptcy, but also enraged critics and the audiences to a degree of making every Cimino&rsquo;s future project destined to fail, both critically and commercially. After his second feature, the world simply expected him to keep delivering in the future. It&rsquo;s extremely difficult to live up to that kind of expectation when you introduce yourself to the world with a film like <em>The Deer Hunter</em>.&nbsp;The gloomy all-American epic story of three steel workers from a small town in Pennsylvania deeply and differently affected by the Vietnam war completely swept the United States off their feet back in 1978, earning five Academy Awards and turning the world&rsquo;s spotlights on Cimino in the process.</p>
<p>Much of its success <em>The Deer Hunter</em> owes to its stellar cast: Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Savage, Meryl Streep and John Cazale in his last performance ever, as he died shortly upon wrapping the film, made sure Deric Washburn and Cimino&rsquo;s story, based on Louis Garfinkle and Quinn K. Redeker&rsquo;s spec script entitled <em>The Man Who Came to Play</em>, got through to the audiences. This is literally one of the most impressively acted films we&rsquo;ve had the privilege of seeing in our lives so far, with numerous motion picture legends making the best of their time on the screen. It&rsquo;s a wonderfully written, extremely dark story of friendship, of dealing with pressure in the worst situations imaginable, of the brutal, arbitrary and essentially incomprehensible nature of war. And even if the misguided critics who slammed <em>Heaven&rsquo;s Gate</em> or <em>Year of the Dragon</em> truly think <em>The Deer Hunter</em> makes Cimino nothing but a one-trick pony&hellip; What a trick it was.</p>
<p>With the usual treat of checking out the brilliant script, take a look at the marvelous behind the scenes photos we&rsquo;ve assembled with the help of our friends, accompanied by De Niro&rsquo;s very own heavily annotated shooting script, Michael Cimino&rsquo;s priceless commentary track and several must-see interviews.</p>
